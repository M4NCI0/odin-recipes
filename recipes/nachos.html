    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is one of my favorite methods for cooking salmon!</p>
        <p>Baked on a bed of onions and jalapeno peppers and thickly covered with seasoned salsa, the salmon stays moist and tender without giving your kitchen any fishy smell.</p>
        <ul>    
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>⅔ cup salsa</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>½ cup diced red onion</li>
            <li>2 medium jalapeno peppers, seeded and thinly sliced</li>    
            <li>2 (8 ounce) skinless salmon fillets, bones removed</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>   
            <li>1 medium avocado, diced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice, or to taste</li>
            <li> ⅓ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>3 cups corn tortilla chips</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced green onion</li>
            <li> 1 small lime, juiced</li>
        </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Generously grease the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish with olive oil.</li>
                    <li>Combine salsa, ground chipotle, and cumin in a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle red onion and jalapenos in an even layer in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place salmon filets over top and season with salt. Generously spoon salsa over the filets and distribute remaining salsa over onions and jalapenos.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven, until salmon is moist and tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 130 degrees F (55 degrees C), about 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, toss diced avocado with lemon juice in a small bowl. Thin sour cream with water in another bowl.</li>
                    <li>Divide chips between two serving plates. Spoon onion-jalapeno mixture over top, along with any accumulated juices, then top with avocado, cilantro, and green onion. Place a salmon filet on top of each plate and drizzle with sour cream. Sprinkle with more green onions and serve with lime.</li>
                </ol>
